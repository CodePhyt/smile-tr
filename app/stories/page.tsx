The digital smile design showed me exactly what to expect, and the results exceeded it. I spent a week in Antalya, staying at a beautiful hotel near the clinic. The whole experience felt like a luxury vacation where I just happened to get my dream smile. Six months later, I still catch myself smiling in every reflection.',

I found Smile Turkey and couldn\'t believe the difference in cost for the same materials - Straumann implants and German ceramics. I stayed for two weeks, got temporary teeth on day three, and returned three months later for the final teeth. The coordination was flawless. My family says I look 15 years younger.',

But my own engagement photos were coming up and I was self-conscious about my chipped front teeth and gaps. I discovered Smile Turkey through a friend\'s recommendation. The process was so easy - they handled everything from airport pickup to hotel booking. My new veneers look so natural that even my close friends thought I just had professional whitening.

I chose Smile Turkey after extensive research - they use the same Nobel Biocare implants my Dubai dentist quoted but at a fraction of the cost. The CT scan and surgical guide made the procedure precise and minimally invasive. I had temporary crowns the same day. The healing was smooth, and I combined the follow-up visit with a beach vacation in Antalya. Best decision I\'ve made for myself.',
